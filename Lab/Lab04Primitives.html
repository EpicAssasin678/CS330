<h1>Lab04</h1>
<p>I do notice when uncommenting the drawArray with mode=LINE_STRIP, the 1st and last 
  vertex do not get attached to one another. drawArray with mode=LINE_LOOP connects
  the first and last of the vertices. Of course LINE only draws lines inbetween pairs 
  of vertices, thus the last is disjointed from the rest. TRIANGLE_STRIP has issues 
  with the lower-half of this render due to the fact that it is connecting triangles 
  using context for triangle <b>a</b> using two fo the previous triangles points <b>b</b>, 
  creating the oblique incision and other triangles from not really  rendering. TRAINGLE_FAN 
  has it's own issues. I believe that because of relying on an initial two points and one new
  point for context when generating a next triangle, the polygon cannot change orientation easily.
  For example two trangles sharing just one point to make a sort of "jagged-teeth" look would 
  be imposible as the initial point <b>p1</b> would instead connect allo other points in 
  respect to itself. <i>This shape would be possible using TRAINGLE_STRIP however</i>.
